You can [delete your GitBook user account](https://www.gitbook.com/settings/delete) at any time. Be careful, this operation **CANNOT** be undone.

Before you do so, you should transfer ownership of any organizations you might own. All books owned by your account will be lost, so you might want to transfer them to another user too. However, discussions and comments you have made in other people's books will remain, becoming anonymous (with Ghost user as author).

Your account name will become available to anyone else to create a new account, and we will stop billing you.
