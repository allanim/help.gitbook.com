If you're getting an error such as `An account with this email address already exists`, it means that you have created two distinct accounts. This happens if you register with a Social Account (Facebook, Twitter, GitHub or Google), then register again using the form.

In this case, you need to **remove** one of these account, to do so:

1. Log out from the account associated with your email
2. Log in using the social account instead
3. Delete this account at [www.gitbook.com/settings](https://www.gitbook.com/settings)
4. Log in again using your email
5. Associate the Social Account to your email account at [www.gitbook.com/settings](https://www.gitbook.com/settings)
