You can create an F.A.Q. with [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook). As a matter of fact, this Help Center is made with GitBook and hosted on [GitBook.com](https://gitbook.com).

To create an F.A.Q., you can install and use the [theme-faq](https://plugins.gitbook.com/plugin/theme-faq). Soon, you will be able to choose a F.A.Q. template from the book creation page on GitBook.com.
